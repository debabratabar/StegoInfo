# StegoInfo
 Maintaining secrecy is very important in a large corporation and because of the intelligent of the hackers it becomes tedious. Already we have cryptography for transmitting secret information. Even though cryptography successfully transmitting secret information, it will give a suspicion to the hackers and it affects unintended users. Our project, StegoInfo overcomes this factor and it gives a solution for transmitting secret formation without affecting unintended users. Steganography uses multimedia data as a covering medium (Covering secret information). By using steganography data (secret information) can hided with in data (multimedia data, here multimedia data is an image) and it can be sent anywhere to transfer the message easily without giving any suspicion to others.
